2. Conform to the existing pattern for listing a tip.
    1. Place it under the correct category.
    2. Give it a brief but descriptive heading.

    4. Link to the original source (a blog post, a tweet, etc.), if any, to give credit to the person who shared it. 
    5. If there isn't a post or a tweet, and it is just a tip you want to share, credit yourself! ðŸ˜„
